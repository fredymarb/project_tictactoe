# Tic Tac Toe
The aim of this project from [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/ruby-tic-tac-toe#project-solution) is to use my new found OOP sea legs to build a game on the command line

This project was also a way for me to meet RuboCop standards, and I can say while a challenge i have been able to meet all of them.
